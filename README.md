## Project Overview
Most helpdesk queues start with an email. Manually reading, tagging, and routing those emails slows response time and adds human error. This workflow:
- Watches for emails with subject "[Helpdesk]".
- ends the body to a small text-classification model (Hugging Face).
- Branches: creates a Jira/ServiceNow ticket, pings Slack for urgent items, or logs the rest in Google Sheets/Airtable.
